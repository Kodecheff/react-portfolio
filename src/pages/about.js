      <p>
        Hello! My name is Pascal, I'm a JavaScript Developer and Technical Writer. I enjoy writing codes and technical articles on the internet. 
        My interest lies in web development which started back in 2019.
      </p>

      <p>
        Fast-forward to today, and Iâ€™ve had the privilege of working at an advertising agency, a start-up, a huge 
        corporation, and a student-led design studio. My main focus these days is building accessible, inclusive products 
        and digital experiences at Upstatement for a variety of clients.
      </p>

        I also recently launched a course that covers everything you need to build a web app with the Spotify API 
        using Node & React.
