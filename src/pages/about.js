      <p>
        Hello! My name is Pascal, I'm a JavaScript Developer and Technical Writer. I enjoy writing codes and technical articles on the internet. 
        My interest lies in web development which started back in 2019. 
      </p>

      <p>
        I love meeting people from different cultural background. I am great with team works and collaboration. 
        I love art and photography, I guess in an alternate universe, I would probably be into Art ü§î. 
        I really love animes and movies; sci-fi, adventure and mystical. I love writing codes, taking walks, photography 
        (I hope to be a photographer some day) Oh yes, I love cooking üòÅ
      </p>

      <p>
        I am currently open to software development and technical writing gigs. If there is any opening in your team and you 
        would love me to be a part of it, kindly contact me, let's chat.
